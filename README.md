Project Euler - Problems
==============

Repository that contains every problems that I took on [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems), you should check it out.

## What is this ? ##

This is a simple repository with procedure for some of the mainstream problems that you can find on Project Euler.

## Why this? ##

**REASONS**. No to be honest I'm doing this only to populate a bit my Github account and fill it with my `knowledge and solving problem skills` in order to create a little resume and a cool repository to watch, fork and pull :-)

## What is Project Euler ? ##

Quote from the site
	
	«Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge,
	and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest
	in the fascinating world of mathematics.»
	
I think that Computer Science is strictly related to Mathematics so that's the basic idea: 
	
	Solving mathematics problems with programming languages

It's nothing new I know, but I want to do it in a different way, I will create a folder for every problem set and inside it I will put the procedure in different programming languages, those who I know most of course.

For further readings about Project Euler see [the About page](http://projecteuler.net/about).

## How do you solve the problems? ##

Actually I will solve the problems with:

- `PHP`
- `Python`
- `Java`
- `C`
- `C++`
- `C#`
- `ADA`

Those are the languages that I know at the moment. I don't know if I will add some other languages, it's not so easy.

## Can I contribute to this? ##
**OF COURSE YOU CAN**

- If you want to pull a solution with different language, I will not cover EVERY problems with all languages, fell free to submit a pull request.
- If you think that you have a faster, or better, solution, feel free to open an issue and we will discuss on it :-)

This is a project from everyone to everyone, no doubt about it. Once a pull request will be merged you will became a **SOLVER** se the `SOLVER.md` file for further details

### Don't have a Project Euler account ? ###

Don't worry, there's even the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file with everyone inside it :-)

## What about License? ##
I think that the proper license for this project is the GPLv2 license, se the `LICENSE` file for further details.
